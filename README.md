#Build a link shortener with a twist using Azure SQL Database

Azure SQL Database is an incredibly powerful data storage technology provided as part of the Microsoft Azure cloud. It provides an extraordinary level of modern SQL capability that can be harnessed quickly and seamlessly. Itâ€™s a very cost-effective way to build out cloud native applications using familiar technologies.
